If you come to Dhaulpur, then you must visit Muchukund Sarovar. This pond was named after King Muchukund. This pond is very ancient. King Muchukunda was the 24th king of the Surya dynasty. It is mentioned in Puranas that King Muchukunda was sleeping here, at the same time Asura Kalayavan reached here following Lord Krishna and he woke up the sleeping King Muchukunda after getting a boon in the illusion of Krishna. At the sight of King Muchukund, Kalayavan was reduced to ashes there. Since then this place is known as a religious place. There are many such places around this place which were built or transformed by Mughal Emperor Akbar. Muchukund Sarovar is called the nephew of all pilgrimages. A very beautiful religious place named Muchukund-Tirtha is situated in the lap of nature, near Dhaulpur, on the left side of the Gwalior-Agra road, at a distance of about two kms. Around this huge and deep reservoir, many small and big temples and places of worship, unique in architecture, were built from 775 AD to 915 AD by Palarajas. A huge fair is held here every year on Bhadrapada Shukla Rishi-Panchami and Baldev-Chhat. In which lakhs of devotees come from far and wide, bathe in this lake and perform tarpan-kriya. There is also a belief that by taking a bath here continuously for seven Sundays, the flow of headache from the ear stops. Thousands of pilgrims circumambulate Muchukund-theertha from early morning on every new moon day. Similarly, on every full moon evening, Muchukund-Sarovarki Maha-Aartika is organized, in which hundreds of devotees participate.
